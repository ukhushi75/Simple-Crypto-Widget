Many of them don't sound like things people would actually say. Look how many positive reviews have been made in the month October 21 alone. It's named Blockfolio which is probably meant to decieve people into thinking it's the popular Blockfolio app which recently changed to ""FTX"". I'm glad I got an error and it didn't work because I think I would regret giving them any information",1

As the top leading cryptocurrency tracker i expected the ability to export your transactions (which is fine without ) as well as having the option to swap crypto pairs and not just buying / selling. That breaks the whole point of crypto trading when swapping capital with another asset. You have to manually sell the asset you are swapping into and it messes up your portfolio as a whole when calculating taxes later in the year.,3

com.coinmarketcap.android,Alfredo Orteg√≥n Sep√∫lveda,"I'm love the new design. It's much more user-friendly and visually appealing. I also appreciate the wide variety of price widgets available. However, I'd suggest adding a news preview widget. This would be incredibly useful for staying up-to-date on the latest cryptocurrency news without having to leave my desktop phone. I envision a widget that displays the headlines and a brief summary. This would be a valuable addition and would make it even more comprehensive.",5

Got the card, kept getting error trying to activate in app, contacted support and they said I violated a term of service so they sold all my cro at 50% loss from temporary dip, and said I had 2 days to remove, kicker was they don't have to tell you what they think you did wrong to prove you didn't per their terms... popular with chat scams 2",1

co.mona.android,Christopher de Vries,2 stars because support team is horrible at responding within the time frame they say. It's been 4 days since I reached out. They said they get in contact within 2 hours. Still waiting for my card to be unfrozen. The idea of the card is great but I've just had issues after issue with it.

co.mona.android,Airjohn Neziri,Hello all. I've been using the app for about 6months now. Pros: A very large library of coins. Relatively clean UI. Easy to read charts. On mobile. Cons: Takes longer than 7 buisness days to clear USD deposits. (So you can't withdraw that cash for at least that time) Customer Support is very slow and not helpful. Even Coinbase is better. Fees are generally higher. They would approve large amounts of deposits ($1000+) but then reject any amount for days after that.,1
